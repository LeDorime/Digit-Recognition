# Number Recognition Python Script

This project demonstrates the implementation of a number recognition system using Python. 
The system leverages machine learning algorithms to recognize hand-written digits from images, using the popular MNIST dataset for training and testing.

## Features

- **Image Preprocessing**: Converts images of handwritten digits into a format suitable for machine learning.
- **Model Training**: Trains a neural network using the MNIST dataset.
- **Prediction**: Recognizes hand-written digits from user-provided images.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluates the model's performance using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The core language used for this project.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Used for building and training the neural network model.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing training progress and results.
- **Pillow**: For image preprocessing and manipulation.
- **MNIST Dataset**: Standard dataset used for training and testing the number recognition model.
